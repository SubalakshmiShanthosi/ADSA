# A2: Sorting methods - Merge Sorting

Design the algorithm and implement in Java

2.	Write a function for Mergesort(a[1..n]) that sorts the elements of the given array in ascending order using  Merge sorting method.


What is Merge Sort Algorithm? 
This popular sorting algorithm works with Divide and Conquer algorithmic pattern. 


This algorithm divides the array into **n-singular blocks** by continuously breaking it into two halves.


--> Input List :-  [2, 4, 1, 5, 7, 2, 6, 1, 1, 6, 4, 10, 33, 5, 7, 23]
